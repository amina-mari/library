# library
This is the first Project on The Odin Project's Javascript Course: a virtual library which keeps the books the user readed or is reading.

The user can add books, delete books and change status of a book.

Here I learned how to use javascript constructors and how to save data in the browser with localStorage so the users don't lose their books when reload the page or reopen after a while
